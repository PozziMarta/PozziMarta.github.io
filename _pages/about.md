I am a first year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan. I based my previous projects and studies on the field of Optimization and Operations Research. 

I'm graduated in mathematics from University of Pavia, with a large number of experiences abroad, from Norway to Portugal passing through France and Saudi Arabia.
